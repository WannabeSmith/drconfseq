\arguments{
\item{y}{The measured outcome (a real vector).}

\item{reg_1}{The predicted outcome in the treatment group
(a real vector).}

\item{reg_0}{The predicted outcome in the control group
(a real vector).}

(a (0, 1)-valued vector)}

\item{treatment}{Whether the subject received treatment
(a boolean vector or 0/1-valued integer vector).}
